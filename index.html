        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I am an aspiring developer with a startup mindset. My philosophy is simple: learn fast, build early, and improve continuously. Instead of waiting to “become ready someday”, I have already started building my foundation today.</p>
        <p>I believe in execution over excuses, clarity over confusion, and consistent growth over overnight success. Every day, I’m improving my skills and preparing myself to build meaningful digital products.</p>

        <h2>Vision & Approach</h2>
        <p>I am not learning development just for certificates. I am learning it to:</p>
        <ul>

            <li>Launch impactful projects</li>
            <li>Build products people actually use</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This portfolio is the first step in that journey.</p>
